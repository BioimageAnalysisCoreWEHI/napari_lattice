# Installation

## Recommended Installation

First, create a new conda environment:

```bash
conda create -n napari-lattice -c conda-forge 'python==3.11.*' uv pycudadecon
```

!!! info

    We include `pycudadecon` to enable GPU accelerated deconvolution.

Activate that environment:

```bash
conda activate napari-lattice
```

Then use `uv` to quickly install the Napari Lattice suite:

```bash
uv pip install lls-core napari-lattice napari-aicsimageio pyqt5
```

!!! info

    `napari-aicsimageio` isn't a dependency of the Lattice suite, but is required for loading the `.czi` files generated by the Lightsheet

## Development Installation

To install the development version of `lls-core`, create the `napari-lattice` environment as above, but instead of installing from pip in the last step:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BioimageAnalysisCoreWEHI/napari_lattice.git
cd napari_lattice
uv pip install -e core -e plugin napari-aicsimageio pyqt5
```
