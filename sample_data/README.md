### Downloading images/sample data

To download any file from Github, 
If its an image, click on the file and you will then see a `Download` button on the right. If you click this, you can download the file.

If the image is `jpg` or `png`, you may see a preview of the image. If the file is not recognised by Github or if its really big to preview, then you'll see the window above.
