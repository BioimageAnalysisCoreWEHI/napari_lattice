This napari plugin allows deskewing, cropping, visualisation and designing custom analysis pipelines for lattice lightsheet data, particularly from the Zeiss Lattice Lightsheet. Support will eventually be for other types of data.


## **Documentation**

Check the [Wiki page](https://github.com/BioimageAnalysisCoreWEHI/napari_lattice/wiki) for documentation on how to get started.

**Functions**

* Deskewing and deconvolution of Zeiss lattice lightsheet images
  * Ability to preview deskewed image at channel or timepoint of interest
* Crop and process only a small portion of the image 
* Import ImageJ ROIs for cropping
* Create image processing workflows using napari-workflows
* Run deskewing, deconvolution and custom image processing workflows from the terminal
* Files can be saved as h5 (BigDataViewer/BigStitcher) or tiff files

**Key Features**

Apply custom image processing workflows using `napari-workflows`. 
* [Interactive workflow generation (no coding experience needed)](https://github.com/BioimageAnalysisCoreWEHI/napari_lattice/wiki/5.-Workflows-(Interactive:-no-coding)#workflow)
* [Use custom python functions/modules within workflows](https://github.com/BioimageAnalysisCoreWEHI/napari_lattice/wiki/5.1-Workflows-(Custom-workflow))
* [How to use Cellpose for cell segmentation](https://github.com/BioimageAnalysisCoreWEHI/napari_lattice/wiki/5.1-Workflows-(Custom-workflow)#cellpose)


Support will be added for more file formats in the future.
